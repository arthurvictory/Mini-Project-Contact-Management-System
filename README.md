# Mini-project: Contact Management System

## Introduction of the Program:

Welcome to my mini project for Coding Temple! This project is based on making a Contact management system.
This project will assist you in managing all your contacts in a list and also write it to a file and import the file back
to the system.

## Installation of the Program:

To install the program make sure you download the .py file and run it in your compiler to execute the program.

## How to use the program:

**Step 1:**
A menu will pop up that will guide you through the program. Press 1 to first add a unique identification to your Users, which will be an email address.
Then enter your name, address and any additional notes you wish to add.

**Step 2:**
After you have added your user you will be brought back to the main menu where you can edit your current user with option 2. Then you will choose your unique
identification from option 1 to edit that user. Another menu will pop so you can choose which settings you wish to edit.

**Step 3:**
Next you can delete a contact from your list with option 3. It will prompt you to type in your unique Identification and will confirm wether you wish to delete that user before doing so.

**Step 4:**
You can then search for a specific contact in your current list with option 4. It will ask again for the unique identification you wish to search for and the current contact will show up on your list.

**Step 5:**
You can then show a display of all your contacts with the current list that was added from option 1, to display this list choose option 5.

**Step 6:**
Lastly you can export your list from your contact management system with option 6. This will export your list to a file that will be automatically created under "unique_id.txt". This can later be imported from that exact same file with option 7.
